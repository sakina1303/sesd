An intelligent full-stack Lost & Found platform that helps users report lost and found items and uses AI-based similarity matching to suggest possible matches automatically.

This system improves the efficiency of recovering lost items and demonstrates strong backend architecture, OOP principles, and system design.

---

##  Problem Statement

Losing personal belongings in public places like colleges, offices, airports, and malls is common. Traditional lost and found systems are manual and inefficient.

This system provides a centralized platform with AI-powered matching to help users recover items faster.

---

##  Key Features

### User Features
-  User Registration and Login (JWT Authentication)
-  Report Lost Items with description, image, and location
-  Report Found Items to help others
-  AI-powered matching suggestions with confidence scores
-  Submit claim requests for matched items
-  View claim status and history
-  Personal dashboard with statistics

### Admin Features
-  View all users
-  View all lost and found items
-  Approve or reject claim requests
-  System analytics and management

### AI Features
-  Text similarity matching using Gemini/OpenAI API
-  Confidence scoring for matches
-  Automatic match suggestions
-  Fallback to basic matching if API unavailable

##  System Architecture

The backend follows **clean architecture principles**:

```
Controllers → handle HTTP requests  
Services → contain business logic  
Repositories → handle database operations  
Models → represent entities  
AI Service → handles matching logic  
```

This ensures **scalability, modularity, and maintainability**.

##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL
- Gemini API Key or OpenAI API Key

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
python app.py
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**📖 For detailed setup instructions, see [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md)**

##  Documentation

- **[SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md)** - Complete installation and configuration guide
- **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** - Get started in 5 minutes
- **[API_TESTING.md](API_TESTING.md)** - API testing with cURL and Postman
- **[idea.md](idea.md)** - Original project concept
- **Diagrams** - See useCaseDiagram.md, sequenceDiagram.md, classDiagram.md, ErDiagram.md

---

## Core Entities

- **User** - System users (regular and admin)
- **LostItem** - Items reported as lost
- **FoundItem** - Items reported as found
- **Claim** - Claim requests for matched items
- **AIMatchService** - AI-powered matching engine

---

##  Authentication

The system uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication:
- Passwords are hashed using Werkzeug
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Role-based access control (User/Admin)

---

##  AI Matching

The AI matching service:
1. Compares text descriptions of lost and found items
2. Uses Gemini or OpenAI API for semantic similarity
3. Returns confidence scores (0-1 scale)
4. Provides match confidence labels (Low, Medium, High, Very High)
5. Falls back to basic word overlap if API unavailable

##  Screenshots

*Coming soon - Add screenshots of your application here*

---

##  Testing

Test the system by:
1. Registering a user account
2. Reporting a lost item (e.g., "Blue iPhone")
3. Reporting a found item with similar description
4. Clicking "Find Matches" to see AI suggestions
5. Submitting a claim
6. Login as admin to approve claims

**Built with ❤️ using Flask, React, and AI**

## How Matching Works

1. User reports lost item
2. System stores item in database
3. AI compares lost item with found items
4. System returns possible matches
5. User submits claim request
6. Admin approves or rejects claim
7. Item status updated and moved to history
